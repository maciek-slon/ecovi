## Task details

Load the `door.jpg` image. Apply one of the edge filters (Sobel, Roberts or Scharr) to it.
Use the output images (there should be two) to calculate two new images - edge strength and edge direction.

Apply edge thinning to the picture and obtain binary edge image (where pixels are either black or white).
