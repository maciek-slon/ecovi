## Task details

Load the `door.jpg` image. Apply one of the edge filters (Sobel, Roberts or Scharr) to it using convolution with two directional kernels (use [conv2](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/conv2.html) function).
Use the output images (there should be two) to calculate two new images - edge strength and edge direction.

Apply edge thinning to the picture and obtain binary edge image (where pixels are either black or white). Try to select the best possible values, so that noise is filtered out, but edges are not broken into small pieces.
