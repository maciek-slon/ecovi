## Problem formulation

The objective of this project is to recognize objects from limited set of classes. Those objects, as can be seen on the picture below, differ in shape and color characteristics. 
There are circles, squares and triangles, each of them available in two different colors. Shapes itself differ inside the classes - triangles has different angles, circles arenot perfectly round, 
every object has different orientation etc.

Whole project should be composed of three main parts:
   * __feature extraction__ from the object image,
   * __training__ of the classifier,
   * __recognition__ of new sample based on trained classifier and features extracted from the test image.
   
## Feature extraction

The basic building block of almost every recognition system is a set of features, that are extracted from the data (picture). Those features should be selected in such a way,
that for objects belonging to the same class feature vectors are close to each other, whilst between the classes difference is as big as possible. Sometimes only a single feature
is enough for recognition, but in presented scenario it is hard to find such. For example, color is not a good single feature, as there are both green squares and triangles.
Similarly, any kind of shape description is also insufficient, as there are two colors of each shape. From this reason, presented system will use a combination of shape and 
color features to describe the objects.

### Image processing

First step in feature extraction is preprocessing of the input image, so that it is in the form that can be used to calculate features.
To remove some noise from the image and make next steps easier, image is passed through smoothing filter. After that a mask is created, that 
segments the image from the background. From the mask another image is created, containing only a perimeter of the object (this will be used in shape description).

### Color features

There are a lot of global color features, that can be used to describe object appearance.  One can calculate average color of the object, taking into account either all channels
or discarding information about brightness, a subset of dominant colors can be extracted after color clustering, or even whole color histograms can be utilized.
All those operations can be done in different color spaces - RGB, HSV, YUV etc.

In presented case simple average hue value was selected as a color description. To select only the pixels belonging to the object mask image is used.
You have to be aware, that hue scale is periodic - it describes color as an angle, where both 0 and 360 degrees means red. In calculation of mean hue value 
that fact must be taken into consideration, i.e. average of 350 degrees and 10 degrees (both meaning red) should be around 0 (red), and not 180 (as it is blue).

### Shape features

As with the colors, shapes can also be described using many different methods. The easiest feature could be, for example, area of the shape. In our scenario, however, 
we want to detect objects regardless of their size, so area alone is not enough. One of the easiest features, that are invariant to scale changes, is circularity.
It tells, how similar to the circle is the analysed object, and is defined as a scaled ratio between area _A_ and perimeter _L_:

$$
circ = 4\Pi\frac{A}{L^2}
$$

Its value is 1 for perfect circle and goes to zero for complex shapes. __Note__: depending on the method of perimeter calculation in Matlab, actual value of this parameter can exceed 1 in some cases.

Final feature vector for the object is composed of two elements: _f = [mean_hue, circ]_.


## Classifier design

The goal of classification process is to classify a test feature to one of the class, based on the set of training features. From many available classifiers
possible __NN__ (nearest neighbour) was selected. For a given test feature its distance to all training features is calculated, and the closest one is selected
as a decision (its class is returned as an output). 

This classifier, although conceptually easy to understand, has some problems. It is sensitive to noise in the training data. If there are some data points from class _A_
close to the points from class _B_, it is possible that some _B_ objects will be classified as _A_, if this noise feature is the closest to the test object.
To overcome this some more complicated classifiers can be used, like __k-NN__ or __bayesian__.

### Classification of test object

As described earlier, classification is done based on distance to the closest training sample. Presented object is closest to the blue triangle, and that is the final decision.

Plot presents all training samples (color shapes) placed on the feature space, where angle depends on first feature (mean hue) and distance from the center is circularity. 
Presentation on polar plot shows proper, periodic interpretation of hue values.
