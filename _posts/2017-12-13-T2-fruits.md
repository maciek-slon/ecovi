## Problem formulation

Based on the methods presented in previous part, design a fruit recognition system, able to recognize five categories presented below:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/public/l3/fruits.jpg)

[Download the pictures]({{site.baseurl}}/public/l3/fruits.zip). Pictures are already cut and rescaled to 256px.

## Requirements and notes

Objects from 0 to 2 should be used __only for testing__, classifier training should be done using objects 3 to 9. 

There should be __at least__ two features used in the process.

Take into consideration, that some training objects have slightly different characteristics than all other representatives (__outlier objects__),
like peeled banana, cut lime or orange with leaf. Try to filter those outliers (automatically based on features, not manually) in training process.

Prepare classifier __different__ than simple NN. It could be either k_NN (with k>=3), bayesian or other presented on the lecture.

Present your results in form of a plot (with training samples and class representatives when applicable) along with table containing
classification result for testing objects (for each of them at least decision - class, and distance should be presented).

## Hints

For shape description, apart from circularity, other methods could be used. Take a note of shape moments and moment invariants (Hu moements).
