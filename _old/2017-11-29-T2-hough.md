## Task details

On the final image acquired in previous task, apply Hough lines detection. Use function [hough](https://mathworks.com/help/images/ref/hough.html) to generate and fill accumulator with _rho_ and _theta_ parameters.

In created accumulator, find peaks (using [houghpeaks](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/houghpeaks.html) function) and compute line equation _y=ax+b_ for every peak:

$$
a=-\cot(\theta)
$$

$$
b=\frac{\rho}{\sin(\theta)}
$$

Try to find the best threshold value, so that the door frame and as little other lines as possible are found. [Draw the lines](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/line.html) on the input image.

## Hints

Note, that `houghpeaks` function returns position of the peak in `H` accumulator. To retrieve actual _rho_ and _theta_ values `R` and `T` matrices (returned from `hough`) should be used. 

{% highlight matlab %}
% create and fill Hough accumulator
[H,T,R] = hough(BW);

% find at most 20 peaks with given threshold
P  = houghpeaks(H, 20, 'Threshold',50);

% retrieve rho and theta for peaks
rho = R(P(:,1));
theta = T(P(:,2));
{% endhighlight %}
